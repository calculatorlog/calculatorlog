🚀 Welcome to My Coding Vibe! 🖥️

Hey there, code enthusiasts! 👋 I'm a passionate developer who lives for tools, testing, and the ultimate VS Code vibe. My mission? To build awesome utilities that make life easier, like the calculators on my personal website, CalculatorLog.com! This repo is my playground for sharing projects, experimenting with code, and spreading the coding love. 🎉





🌟 What I Do

I’m all about creating practical tools and mastering the art of testing to ensure rock-solid code. My go-to editor? VS Code, customized with extensions that make coding feel like a party! 🎈 My flagship project is CalculatorLog.com, where I publish a variety of calculators for everything from math to finance. Whether it’s debugging with Jest or crafting a sleek UI, I’m here to vibe with code and share the journey.





🔧 Tools: Building utilities that solve real problems.



🧪 Testing: Writing tests to keep code bulletproof (think Jest, Mocha).



💻 VS Code: Living in the editor with extensions like Prettier and Live Server.
